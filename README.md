If you use this data, please also cite several other works from which that we build this corpus upon. See [Citation Information](#citation).

## Quickstart:

Our recommendation is to access the corpus on huggingface:

https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest

```python

from datasets import load_dataset

# load train/val/test splits for each task
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "matching")
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "ranking")
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "explanation")

# load in the "from pixels" setting
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "ranking_from_pixels")

# we ran in cross val (split 0 is default ^ ) so you can load splits 1/2/3/4 this way the 4th data split
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "explanation_4")
# ... or split 1...
dset = load_dataset("jmhessel/newyorker_caption_contest", "explanation_from_pixels_1")
```

Here's an example instance from Matching:
```
{'caption_choices': ['Tell me about your childhood very quickly.',
                     "Believe me . . . it's what's UNDER the ground that's "
                     'most interesting.',
                     "Stop me if you've heard this one.",
                     'I have trouble saying no.',
                     'Yes, I see the train but I think we can beat it.'],

 'n_tokens_label': 1,
 'questions': ['What is the bartender saying on the phone in response to the '
               'living, breathing, stereotypical bar joke that is unfolding?']}
```

The label "C" indicates that the 3rd choice in the caption_choices is correct.


## Cross-validation setting

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/jmhessel/caption_contest_corpus/assets/178075/585cee7f-7f06-4be4-bda5-c17be5e6b014" width=512>
</p>

The results in the paper are reported in the *cross-validation setting* which is different than the leaderboard setting. The official evaluation script for computing accuracy is [eval_crossval.py](eval_crossval.py) For an end-to-end example of the cross-validation setting, you can check out the 5-shot/0-shot [GPT-4](gpt4/) scripts, which reproduce the reported values from the paper.

## Leaderboard setting

We have a fully-held out test set leaderboard. *Note: the leaderboard distribution may differ from the cross-validation distribution because the data is constructed differently. The raw values thus may differ from those reported in the paper*. For an end-to-end example of training a model and then submitting to the leaderboard, you can check out the [CLIP](clip/) training/prediction scripts.

### How to submit to the matching leaderboard

The official leaderboard is hosted [here!](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/nycc-matching/submissions/public)
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://leaderboard.allenai.org/assets/images/leaderboard/nycc_matching/logo.svg" width=128>
</p>

How to submit:

1. Download the leaderboard instances from `https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic-public/projects/nycc/matching_test_set_public.zip`, and unzip them like `unzip matching_test_set_public.zip`.
This folder contains the test set cartoon jpgs, along with `instances.json`.
```
$ ls matching_test_set_public
061c2794c6d17002115c9d6f3a18a702.jpg
089263e1b961b2fe115073d23c2e7a3a.jpg
1b8bd2c09fe0f8fcbcbddd760d2815af.jpg
1c0b5b3cf8095549f137ec750d87c90a.jpg
...
instances.json
```
2. Produce a prediction using your model for each instance in `instances.json`. Each of the 830 leaderboard matching instances looks like this:
```
{'choices': {'A': 'It drops down once we have maxed his insurance',
             'B': 'It was at this exact moment when Brenda asked herself, “are '
                  'you really happy with Frank?',
             'C': 'Wait: You have thumbs? !',
             'D': 'I think we need a longer apartment.',
             'E': "It's cannabis. They never get far."},
 'image': 'd4f8a9ad80270b103bc8c7fa1be89a81.jpg',
 'instance_id': '5dc4f6a5648682c5beabba053e7a112c'}
```
Your job is to produce a json that maps from `instance_id` to one of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `E`, depending on which your model predicts as the correct caption, e.g., `{"5dc4f6a5648682c5beabba053e7a112c": "A", ...}`

3.  Save that json to `matching_predictions.json`, upload the file to the server, and follow the directions from there!

### How to submit to the ranking leaderboard

The official leaderboard is hosted [here!](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/nycc-ranking/submissions/public)
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://leaderboard.allenai.org/assets/images/leaderboard/nycc_ranking/logo.svg" width=128>
</p>

1. Download the leaderboard instances from `https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-mosaic-public/projects/nycc/ranking_test_set_public.zip`, and unzip them like `unzip ranking_test_set_public.zip`.
This folder contains the test set cartoon jpgs, along with `instances.json`.
```
$ ls ranking_test_set_public
061c2794c6d17002115c9d6f3a18a702.jpg
089263e1b961b2fe115073d23c2e7a3a.jpg

1c0b5b3cf8095549f137ec750d87c90a.jpg
...
instances.json
```
2. Produce a prediction using your model for each instance in `instances.json`. Each of the 664 leaderboard ranking instances looks like this:
```
{'choices': {'A': 'Looks to be a herniated disco.',
             'B': 'Everyone, wish upon a star!'},
 'image': 'fc79106cf3660f5b81cdbeed0f968d98.jpg',
 'instance_id': 'cba6d1ce5711ad56c31e5577f3207ac3'}
```
Your job is to produce a json that maps from `instance_id` to one of `A` or `B` depending on which your model predicts as the correct caption, e.g., `{"cba6d1ce5711ad56c31e5577f3207ac3": "A", ...}`

3.  Save that json to `ranking_predictions.json`, upload the file to the server, and follow the directions from there!

### How to submit to the explanation leaderboard

There is no automatic explanation leaderboard. We had initially hoped to support automatic evaluation, but, because difficult cases still pose a challenge for even LLM-backed metrics in terms of human correlation, we decided to not host an explanation generation leaderboard. If you are interested in automatic evaluation of joke explanations, we do have instances and annotations we collected that are currently unused. Feel free to get in touch if you're interested in working with that data; we'd love to hear if there's interest in this corpus.

## Cartoon images

[You can download all of the contests images here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-jack-public/caption_contest_data_public/all_contest_images.zip) Each is named `X.jpeg` where `X` is the `contest_number`.

## Raw annotation files

<p align="center">
  <img src="data_teaser.png" width=1024px>
</p>

[The cartoon annotations described in the paper are here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-jack-public/caption_contest_data_public/all_newyorker_contest_annotations.json.zip) The keys in this json are the contest numbers. These map to:

```
{'contest_number': 322,
 'contest_source': 'bob',
 'contest_type': 'bob_okay',
 'official_newyorker_finalists': ['“On a clear day, I can get Santa Fe on the '
                                  'antenna.”',
                                  '"At the next canyon, I\'ll show you why."',
                                  "“Nope, it's not a new haircut. Try again.”"]
 'mturk_annotations': {'description_hit': [...],
                       'links_hit': [...]}
}
```
The contest source indicates whether the data was from the earlier dataset (`bob`), or the more recent datasets: `nextml_1` is from [here](https://github.com/nextml/caption-contest-data); `nextml_2` is from [here](https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data/). Contests with `contest_type` of `bob_small` were the set of images with low resolution that we treated with special care, as described in the paper.

The annotations themselves are stored in `description_hit` and `links_hit` respectively. For each contest, we ran the `description_hit` three times and the `links_hit` twice. Each entry in these lists corresponds to a single annotator's work (more details in paper). `description_hit` data looks like:

```
{'hash_worker_id': '20661b6a12f02ad760751e35d68cf3b6',
 'image_description': 'Two scientists are talking in a lab, with a cage full '
                      'of mice off to the left. One of the scientists is '
                      'dressed like a rat.',
 'image_uncanny_description': 'The scientist is wearing a rat costume instead '
                              'of a lab coat.',
 'question_1': 'Why is he dressed like that?',
 'question_2': None}
```

`question_X` was unused in our experiments, but we distribute it anyway. `None` indicates an optional question that did not get an answer. `links_hit` data looks like:

```
{'hash_worker_id': '9feb7ad429cbe82dcc6490b574465c13',
 'image_location': 'medical testing facility',
 'link_1': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist',
 'link_2': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat',
 'link_3': None}
```

[We also release a flattened version of our joke explanations here](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-jack-public/caption_contest_data_public/joke_explanations_flat.json.zip):

```
[{'caption': 'Please! I have a wife and two thousand kids!',
  'contest_number': 509,
  'explanation': 'A play on the common plea people use in dire situations: "I '
                 'have a wife and two kids;" this is stated to try to have '
                 'people take mercy and not kill someone. But here, the victim '
                 'of the bear is a fish about to be eaten, and fish tend to '
                 'have many more than two kids, so the phrase is updated with '
                 'the fish-version of it: two thousand kids.',
  'n_expl_toks': 70}, ... ]
```

<summary> * Other ways of accessing the data* </summary>

[Task splits can be downloaded here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-jack-public/caption_contest_data_public/tasks.zip)
Because the size of the dataset is relatively small, we report
evaluation metrics averaged over the "test" portion of 5-fold
different cross validation splits. Each json has 3 keys: `train`,
`val`, `test`, and each of these keys gives a list of the examples in
the corresponding split.

```
tasks
├── contest_matching_split=0_cleaned.json
├── contest_matching_split=1_cleaned.json
...
├── explanation_generation_split=0_cleaned.json
├── explanation_generation_split=1_cleaned.json
...
├── quality_ranking_split=0_cleaned.json
├── quality_ranking_split=1_cleaned.json
...
```

#### Matching

Format of examples:

```
{'choices': [{'clean_caption': '"When is it ever a good time to break up?',
              'source': 'official_winner'},
             {'clean_caption': "They didn't specify which one, but your "
                               'insurance will only cover half.',
              'source': 'official_winner'},
             {'clean_caption': 'A bunny. Seriously. You see a bunny.',
              'source': 'crowd_winner'},
             {'clean_caption': "Do that again and I'll put the rubber bands "
                               'back on.',
              'source': 'crowd_winner'},
             {'clean_caption': 'I just do it for the healthcare.',
              'source': 'official_winner'}],
 'contest_number': 332,
 'correct_idx': 0,
 'split_idx_for_neg_match': 1}
```

`correct_idx` gives the index of the correct answer in this list,
which, in this case, is "When is it ever a good time to break
up?". `source` indicates if this was an official New Yorker finalist,
or a finalist from crowd voting.

#### Ranking

Format of examples:

```
{'A': "The neighborhood's not like I remembered it.",
 'B': 'Please! I have a wife and two thousand kids!',
 'contest_number': 509,
 'label': 'B',
 'winner_source': 'official_winner'}
```

`A`/`B` are the options to choose between, with `label` being the
correct answer.  `winner_source` gives where the correct answer comes
from (the incorrect answer is from a selection of "okay" captions as
determined by crowd voting --- see paper for more details).


#### Explanation

Format of examples:
```
{'caption': 'You know, I can never define irony, but I know it when I see it.',
 'contest_number': 607,
 'explanation': "It's extremely ironic that death himself would die: so ironic "
                'that the person points this out as an exemplar of the often '
                'difficult to pin down concept.',
 'n_expl_toks': 28}
```

Fields are self-explanatory, except `n_expl_toks`, which is the number
of tokens used in the perplexity calculation.


#### Annotations for tasks

For the "from description" setting described in the paper, at test time, only one description per cartoon is available.
For reproducibility, we use the same descriptions at val/test time between all algorithms. To facilitate fair comparison,
[we release per-split cartoon annotations here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/ai2-jack-public/caption_contest_data_public/annotations_per_split.zip)

```
annotations_per_split
├── split=0_newyorker_contest_annotations.json
├── split=1_newyorker_contest_annotations.json
├── split=2_newyorker_contest_annotations.json
├── split=3_newyorker_contest_annotations.json
└── split=4_newyorker_contest_annotations.json
```

These files have the [same format described above](#annotations), but the val/test sets only have
a single fixed description/link HIT, so we recommend using these annotations if you are running
in the "from description" cross-validation setup.
